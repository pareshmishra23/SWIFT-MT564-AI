In ISO 20022, the equivalent functionality to MT564 is covered by messages like the Corporate Action Notification (seev.031.001.xx). The transition to ISO 20022 allows for more detailed and structured data, such as enhanced corporate action event details and options, and supports XML-based messaging for better machine readability and processing."
