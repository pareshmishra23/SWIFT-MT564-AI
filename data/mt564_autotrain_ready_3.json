    "input": "",
    "output": "Anomalies in an MT564 message can be identified by: \n1. Checking for unusually high quantities in fields like :36B::ENTL (e.g., quantities exceeding 1,000,000 units). \n2. Verifying currency codes in :19A::SETT against standard ISO 4217 currencies (e.g., USD, EUR), flagging non-standard codes like XAU. \n3. Ensuring recipient country codes in :95Q::RCPT do not belong to sanctioned countries (e.g., IR, KP). \n4. Validating sequence names against the MT564 standard (e.g., Sequence E must be CAOPTN, not SECMOVE)."

  {
    "instruction": "What compliance checks are required for the :95Q::RCPT field in MT564?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The :95Q::RCPT field specifies the recipient party, including a country code. It must be checked against international sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC, UN). Country codes like IR (Iran), KP (North Korea), or others on sanctions lists indicate a compliance violation and require further review."

    "instruction": "What currencies are allowed in the :19A::SETT field of MT564?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The :19A::SETT field in MT564 must use standard ISO 4217 currency codes (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, JPY). Non-standard codes like XAU (gold) are not typically used for corporate action settlements and should be flagged as anomalies."

    "instruction": "What should be done if a non-standard sequence like SECMOVE appears in MT564?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "In MT564, Sequence E must be labeled CAOPTN (Corporate Action Options). A non-standard sequence like SECMOVE indicates a formatting error or modification. The message should be flagged for correction, and Sequence E should be restructured as CAOPTN with appropriate fields (e.g., :13A::CAON, :22F::CAOP)."
